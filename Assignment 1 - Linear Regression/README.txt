1. DESCRIPTION

Part1_A1
Part1_A2
Part1_A3
Part1_A4

These are the source codes for each part respectively.

Open Part1_A1 first and run. This would save noisedata.csv in the working directory.
This same noise data is used in Part2 by opening this csv file as an array.
This is only to maintain the same values in Part1 and Part2 so that the graphs 
obtained in Part2 are coherent with the parameter values obtained in Part1.
This was only done to bypass the random function, otherwise data generated for Part2
would be different than that of Part1 which would mean that the graphs so obtained
do not reflect the same model of Part1. The csv file is noisedata.csv in which the
noise from Part1 gets stored

In this zipped folder, you will also find essential charts saved which have been put up
in the report as well.
